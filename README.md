## What Problem Does This Solve?

**The Challenge**: Setting up NVIDIA H100 Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) configurations is complex and error-prone. Teams waste weeks figuring out optimal memory allocation, instance distribution, and isolation strategies for their AI workloads.

**The Solution**: This tool uses AI analysis to instantly generate production-ready MIG configurations with proper resource isolation, eliminating conflicts between inference services and training pipelines.

**Real Impact**: 
- ❌ **Before**: Manual configuration → resource conflicts → $50K+ in downtime 
- ✅ **After**: AI-optimized setup → perfect isolation → zero interference
