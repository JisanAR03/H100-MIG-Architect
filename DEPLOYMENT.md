## 📊 **Points**

**"I deployed this using Netlify Functions to create a secure API proxy architecture. This demonstrates production-level security practices - the API key is never exposed to the client, all requests go through a backend function, and the application is ready for enterprise use."**

**"The architecture shows full-stack thinking: secure backend API, responsive frontend, CI/CD with automatic deployments, and proper environment variable management."**

Then load it in your build process.

### Demo Mode
Use the "Try Demo Mode" button to showcase functionality without API calls.
